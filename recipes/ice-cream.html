    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups chilled heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add heavy cream to the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment. Beat on medium-high speed until stiff
            peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add sweetened condensed milk, vanilla and salt. Mix on low speed until fully combined, 20 to 30 seconds,
            scraping sides of bowl as needed. </li>
        <li>Transfer mixture into a 9x5-inch loaf pan, spreading evenly in the pan. Cover with plastic wrap, gently
            pressing down to touch the ice cream mixture and seal out any air bubbles. Freeze until firm, at least 6
            hours before serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
